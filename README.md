# Main Components


## I. Online Course Landing Page
### The Secrets Of the Alchemy
RO/EN Versions of Online Course Landing page.
Contains combinations of self-generated CSS & JS animations - together with leveraging popular modern libraries - All customized towards Website's Theme.  


## II. Project YLF

Starting point: **Stand-Alone Python trained Large Language Model** [Project YLF](https://github.com/LaoWater/LLM-Create-Process-Train).  

### Explore the full project on
[![GitHub Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repository-Visit-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/LaoWater/LLM-Create-Process-Train)

This app has been **integrated** into the Web App's framework to align with **business needs and context**.

---

### Key Features
1. **LLM Integration**  
   - **Dataset**: Trained on the company's processed dataset.  
   - **Multi-Agent Orchestration Pipeline**: Designed for **rating** and **processing** model responses.
   
2. **Architecture**  
   - **Trained Model**:
     - Receives a prompt and generates an answer.
   - **First-Layer LLM**:
     - Rates the model's answers based on:
       - **Safety**
       - **Context Awareness**
       - **Helping Sentiment**
     - If scoring is below the threshold, it calls the YLF model again, repeating the process until the **threshold is met** or the **attempt limit is reached**.
   - **Second-Layer LLM**:
     - Performs a **final review** and applies **Markdown formatting** to the response.

3. **User-Friendly Design**  
   - A **smooth and responsive UI** for both PC and mobile platforms.

4. **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) Integration**  
   - **Feedback Workflow**:
     - Each response can be flagged as **inappropriate** or **unsatisfactory**.
     - Users have the option to provide **complex feedback** via a multi-Dimensions Rating workflow. This feedback is collected & stored - used for RLHF in future model iterations.

## **Installation and Deployment Guide**

**1. Install Requirements**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Environment Variables**

Set up the following environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.
- `SECRET_KEY_DB_EXPORT`: Secret key for fetching the database from cloud. 
- `EMAIL_HOST_USER`: Email address for Django's email exchange.
- `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`: Password for the above email address.

**For Local Development:**

With the environment variables configured, you're ready to proceed with local development.

**3. Deployment Requirements**

The current architecture deploys the app on Google Cloud App Engine, utilizes Firebase for storing user model data, and includes an internal pipeline for synchronizing databases. 
This setup ensures a safe and smooth user experience suitable for low to medium scaling. As the application grows, consider transitioning to a server-side database for enhanced performance.

**Key Deployment Files:**

- `app.yaml`: Configuration file for Google App Engine deployment. Load the necessary environment variables here or set them up using Google Secrets.
- `entrypoint` Scripts: These scripts run upon deployment. In the current framework of continuous SQLite deployment and synchronization, we use `./startup.sh` to sync the databases and start the web app using Gunicorn.

**Deployment Steps:**

1. **Set Up Google Cloud Project:**

   - Create a new project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Enable the App Engine and related APIs.

2. **Configure `app.yaml`:**

   ```yaml
   runtime: python39
   entrypoint: ./startup.sh
   ...
    ```
   
3**Deploy the Application:**

   ```bash
   gcloud app deploy
   ```

   For a detailed walkthrough, refer to this [tutorial on deploying a Django app to Google App Engine](https://testdriven.io/blog/django-gae/).

**Note:** Ensure that all environment variables are securely managed.
