        <!-- Section 1: Why Do Current Methods Fail? -->
        <div class="section section-failure-reasons">
            <h2>Why Do Current Methods Fail?</h2>
            <p><br>Most fitness methods, diets, or programs have a high failure rate. Why? Because they offer you the "fish" (the tool) without truly teaching you how to "fish" (the system). In other words, the solutions are often applied directly without a deep understanding of how the Body and Mind work.</p>

            <h3><br>Examples of "Isolation" in Current Systems</h3>
            <ul class="custom-list">
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i> <strong>Physical Training</strong>: Emphasis on aesthetics rather than the body's natural movement, mobility, or efficiency. Movement should be the source of health, not merely a means to achieve a “magazine-worthy body”.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i> <strong>Psychotherapy</strong>: Rigid theoretical models that do not adapt to the uniqueness of each individual.<br>As C.G. Jung once said:</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>"In order to truly interpret someone's dreams and mental patterns, I should know them for at least half of their life."</em></p>

            <ul class="custom-list">
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i> <strong>Emotional Healing Programs</strong>: Emphasis on excessive introspection and analysis without direct action. Lessons must be lived, not just analyzed.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-dumbbell"></i> <strong>Medical Rehabilitation</strong>: The concept of "treating the Body like a sheet of paper" – exercises prescribed within four walls, addressing the body uniformly and in isolation.<br></li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Section 2: Why Does This Isolation Occur? -->
        <div class="section section-reason-isolation">
            <h3>Why Does This Isolation Occur?</h3>
            <p>Isolation stems from the desire to deeply understand each branch.<br>Fragmentation has led to major scientific discoveries, such as:</p>
            <ul class="custom-list">
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-fire"></i> <strong>Thermodynamics</strong> – energy exchange</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-atom"></i> <strong>Physics</strong> – the laws of the universe</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i> <strong>Neuroscience</strong> – how the mind and brain work</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-user-md"></i> <strong>Medicine</strong> – mechanisms of disease and treatment</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But fragmentation is useful only for exploration.<br><span class="underline">Greatness does not come through separation, but through integration</span>.</p>

        <!-- Section 3: Reintegration – The Art of Life -->
        <div class="section section-life-art">
            <h2>Reintegration – The Art of Life</h2>
            <p><br>Imagine the device you are reading on right now. It wasn’t created by just one branch of knowledge. It is a synthesis of:</p>
            <ul class="custom-list">
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-square-root-alt"></i> <strong>Mathematics</strong> – algorithms, logarithms, cryptography</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-fire"></i> <strong>Thermodynamics</strong> – energy control, heat dissipation</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-bolt"></i>&nbsp; <strong>Physics</strong> – electricity, electromagnetism, wireless technology</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i> <strong>Neuroscience</strong> – artificial neural networks</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa-microchip"></i> <strong>Electronic Engineering</strong> – electronic circuits</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each branch is indispensable. That’s why learning only one part is like trying to build a device with a single component.</p>

        <!-- Section 4: Ancient Wisdom -->
        <div class="section section-ancient-wisdom">
            <h3>Ancient Wisdom</h3>
            <p>Even in sacred texts, the idea of integration—not replacement—appears. One example comes from the words of the Son of God:</p>
            <em>
                <p>"I have not come to abolish the prophecies of the past, but to fulfill them."</p>
            </em>
            <p>This phrase perfectly encapsulates the essence of the integration process. There is no need to reject anything. There is no need to replace anything. You only need to complement.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 5: Conclusion -->
        <div class="section section-conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion: Integration, Not Separation</h2>
            <p><br>The separation of systems that should work together — Mind, Body, and Soul — has become the norm. But physiology, psychology, emotions, and movement are not isolated compartments.<br><br>They are more like rivers that flow together into a larger stream.</p>
            <p>Any new method should complement the others, not replace them.<br>Every method has its value. Every branch has its role.
                <br><i class="fa-solid fa-key icon" style="color:#5DADE2;"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Integration, not isolation.</p>
